    # match this virtual host. For the default virtual host (this file) this
    # value is not decisive as it is used as a last resort host regardless.

    # Environment.
    # Possible values: "prod" and "dev" out-of-the-box, other values possible with proper configuration
    # Defaults to "prod" if omitted (uses SetEnvIf so value can be used in rewrite rules)
    # NB: Do NOT use SetEnv here, as it is executed after mod_rewrite! SetEnvIf instead is executed Before!
    SetEnvIf Request_Method .* ENVIRONMENT=${SYMFONY_ENV_NOVARNISH}

    # Whether to use Symfony's ApcClassLoader.
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 0 if omitted, supported on 5.2 and higher
    #SetEnv USE_APC_CLASSLOADER 0

    # Prefix used when USE_APC_CLASSLOADER is set to 1.
    # Use a unique prefix in order to prevent cache key conflicts
    # with other applications also using APC.
    # Defaults to "ezpublish" if omitted, supported on 5.2 and higher
    #SetEnv APC_CLASSLOADER_PREFIX "ezpublish"

    # Whether to use debugging.
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 0 if omitted, unless ENVIRONMENT is set to: "dev", supported on 5.2 and higher
    # NB: the value is defined here even for 'dev', because it is used in the rewrite rule later on
    SetEnvIf Request_Method .* USE_DEBUGGING=1

    # Whether to use Symfony's HTTP Caching.
    # Disable it if you are using an external reverse proxy (e.g. Varnish)
    # Possible values: 0 or 1
    # Defaults to 1 if omitted, unless ENVIRONMENT is set to: "dev", supported on 5.2 and higher
    #SetEnv USE_HTTP_CACHE 1

    # Defines the proxies to trust.
    # Separate entries by a comma
    # Example: "proxy1.example.com,proxy2.example.org"
    # By default, no trusted proxies are set, supported on 5.2 and higher
