Getting started with the Exercises
==================================

Eight exercises in total are available to be executed for the workshop.

## The overarching goal

The storyline reflects a typical web development project lifecycle, starting after initial project setup and when
development proper is underway or close to completion:

- you start out with a fully working DEV environment for the website

- you need to set a fully working UAT environment, including:
    * changes to configuration files
    * dumping the DEV database and importing it into UAT
    
- you should also *automate* the following tasks, which are commonly executed after the 1st deployment of the UAT environment:
    * managing changes to db structure
    * execution of functional tests to insure proper functioning of the site and avoid regressions
    * roll out of new versions of the site

## The exercises

Every exercise starts with a brief description of the task, followed by all the commands necessary for completion.

You can copy-paste every single command and get through to the end, as long as you understand what is going on.

Or you can just read the descriptions and figure out the solutions for yourself, using the given solution as reference.
